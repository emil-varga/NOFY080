# the files are named ..., data_9.txt, data_10.txt, ...
# sorting on strings (i.e., filenames) works alphabeticaly, which 
# places data_10 before data_9. If we want to sort them according
# to their numerical labels, we have to specify the sorting key
# which is a function, that takes whatever is inside the list and
# returns something sortable (usually a number)

# whenever you see a complex function call, you should read it
# inside out, i.e. let's assume that s is 
# 'lots_of_data/data_9.txt', the evaluation goes as follows
# 1. basename('lots_of_data/data_9.txt') = 'data_9.txt'
# 2. split('[_.]', 'data_9.txt') = ['data', '9', 'txt']
# 3. (['data', '9', 'txt'])[1] = '9'
# 4. int('9') = 9

# The function split() splits according to any regular expression,
# which can be quite complex. Here, the simple "[_.]" means that
# it should split at any of the characters inside []
